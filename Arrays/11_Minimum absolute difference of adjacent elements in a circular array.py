Minimum absolute difference of adjacent elements in a circular array
Given n integers, which form a circle. Find the minimal absolute value of any adjacent pair. If there are many optimum solutions, output any of them.
Note: they are in circle

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {10, 12, 13, 15, 10}
Output : 0
Explanation: |10 - 10| = 0 which is the
minimum possible.

Input : arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40}
Output : 10
Explanation: |10 - 20| = 10 which is the
minimum, 2 3 or 3 4 can be the answers also.
